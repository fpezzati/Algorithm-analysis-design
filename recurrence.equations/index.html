  Recurrence equation is a recursive formula who express a sequence's n-th element
  in relation with the previous $n-1$ elements. Recurrence equation is of order
  $r$ when n-th element is directly related with $n-1, n-2, \dots, n-r$ previous elements.
  Recurrence equations are often used to express recursive algorithms behavior.
  Just think about mergesort complexity. We can describe how it behave by the
  recurrence equation:
  $$ C_n = C_{n/2} + C_{n/2} + n, C_0 = 1;  $$
  There are a lot of recurrence equation types:
  <ul>
    <li>first order
      <ul>
        <li>linear</li>
        <li>not linear</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>second order
      <ul>
        <li>linear</li>
        <li>not linear</li>
        <li>with variables</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>order $t$</li>
    <li>full history</li>
    <li>divide et impera</li>
  </ul>
  Recurrence equations are represented by a "first step" equation and the recursive
  part.
  $$
  \begin{cases}
  T(n) = T(n-1)+\Theta(1) \\
  T(1) = \Theta(1)
  \end{cases}
  $$
  The recursive part should be always made by the recursive segment ($T(n-1)$) and
  a constant who represent the effort the algorithm required to compute all that
  is not part of recursive step. The non-recursive step part can't be ignored because
  it is always present in algorithms and it states that input set size matters.
  Problems arise when you want to translate recurrence equantions in a equation
  you can use to analyze algorithm's asymptotic behavior. So, how to deal with recurrence
  equations? There are few ways.
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h4>Substitution approach</h4>
      You guess a solution and check if it works. You have to guess it as near as
      possible to solution. All the guess smaller than solution will work if we
      are tryin to find a $\Omega$, and all the guess larger than solution will work
      if we are tryin to find a $O$.
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Iterative approach</h4>
    </li>
    <li>Tree approach.</li>
    <li>Main approach.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Substitution approach</h4>
  Let be
  $$
  \begin{cases}
  T(n) = T(n-1)+\Theta(1) \\
  T(1) = \Theta(1)
  \end{cases}
  $$
  the algorithm we want to shape in a linear form to study it's asymptotic behavior.
  We move Landau notation about costants:
  $$
  \begin{cases}
  T(n) = T(n-1)+c \\
  T(1) = d
  \end{cases}
  $$
  and we guess that this algorithm has $T(n) = O(n)$ behavior, so $T(n) \leq kn$.
  So $T(1) = k$ and this is fine if $k \leq d$. Now
  $$
  \begin{align}
  T(n) \leq k(n-1)+c = kn-k+c \leq kn
  -k \leq -c
  k \geq c
  \end{align}
  $$
  So solution is solid if $k \geq c$ and $k \geq d$. A $k$ value like can be always
  found so solution is solid: algorithm has a $O(n)$ behavior.
  $$
  \begin{cases}
  T(n) = T(n-1)+\Theta(1) \\
  T(1) = \Theta(1)
  \end{cases}
  $$
  <h4>Iterative approach</h4>
  In the iterative approach you find the linear equation by exploding the $n$th
  iterative step in the $n-1$th plus $\Theta(n)$. Let's put this simple. Let
  $$
  \begin{cases}
  T(n) = T(n-1)+\Theta(1) \\
  T(1) = \Theta(1)
  \end{cases}
  $$
  be the functions who describe our algorithm. The algorithm is the sequential search.
  Explode $T(n)$ in $T(n-1)+\Theta(1)$ and $T(n-1)$ in $T(n-2)+\Theta(1)$ and so
  on:
  $$
  T(n) = T(n-1) + \Theta(1) = T(n-2)+\Theta(1)+\Theta(1) = \ldots = n \Theta(1) = n
  $$
  this is a simple case. Let's try iterative approach agains a binary search algorithm.
  Binary search can be represented as:
  $$
  \begin{cases}
  T(n) = T(n/2)+\Theta(1) \\
  T(1) = T(0) = \Theta(1)
  \end{cases}
  $$
  Let's apply the iterative approach:
  $$
  T(n) = T(n/2) + \Theta(1) = T(n/2^2) + \Theta(1) + \Theta(1) = \\
  T(n/2^3) + \Theta(1) + \Theta(1) + \Theta(1) = \ldots = \\
  T(n/2^n) + n \Theta(1) = \log_2 n \Theta(n) = \Theta(log_2 n)
  $$
  Now let's try the iterative approach against algorithm who compute Fibonacci's
  series.
  $$
  \begin{cases}
  T(n) = T(n-1) + T(n-2) + \Theta(1) \\
  T(1) = T(0) = 1
  \end{cases}
  $$
  If we try to substitute equations with their previous steps we will see that operands
  grows in number too fast and we can't find a linear representation. But we can
  say that $T(n) \leq 2T(n-1)+\Theta(1)$ and $T(n) \geq 2T(n-2)+\Theta(1)$. We can
  use these two observations to find linear representations of $O$ and $\Theta$
  about the algorithm.
